In this SQL project, I was working in a *Coursera* course called **Intro to SQL dor Data Science Specialization**. The point of this project, which I did individually, was to create some tables using DBeaver, cleaning the data, and finally answer some questions about it. This way I could find the answer to questions like:

- Which states had cheese production greater than 100 million in April 2023?
- Find the total yogurt production for states in the year 2022 which also have cheese production data from 2023?
- Or, find the average coffee production for all years where the honey production exceeded 1 million.

These are just some questions I was able to answer. There are several more in the SQL file, and you can take a loot at it which is above!
